# Video Code Review ðŸŽ¥
This is a working prototype of a Rails powered peer code review video platform. The primary objective of the project is to help students learn - they will receive feedback more quickly, and also develop their skills at reviewing the work of others'.

Links to submit video can be embedded into a curriculum, with a query param denoting the piece of content that is being submitted. The link directs a user to a form, where they can upload the video to a server. If another user has submitted a response to the same content, they will be asked if they could spare the time to review another student's work.

Course administrators can be provided with a dashboard to view all students' submissions to have oversight into the quality of the reviews provided.
